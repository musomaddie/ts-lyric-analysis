Follow me home, if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances
When no one took chances on me
So, I watch from the dark
Wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory
<PARAGRAPH>
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets
Alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something
Something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms
I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
<PARAGRAPH>
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light, before the dawning
Out here the wild ones
Are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends
And be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream
<PARAGRAPH>
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets
Alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something
Something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms
I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
<PARAGRAPH>
And so maybe my home
Isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive
With these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe
But it's wild and it's free
<PARAGRAPH>
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets
Alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them I have something
Something to cling to
I never knew I'd love
This world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
<PARAGRAPH>
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
