Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
<PARAGRAPH>
And it said
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
<PARAGRAPH>
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
<PARAGRAPH>
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
<PARAGRAPH>
Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
<PARAGRAPH>
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
<PARAGRAPH>
New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
<PARAGRAPH>
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
