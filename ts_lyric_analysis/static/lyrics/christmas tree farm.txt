My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress, and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic
<PARAGRAPH>
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
<PARAGRAPH>
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too
<PARAGRAPH>
Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
<PARAGRAPH>
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
<PARAGRAPH>
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We'd run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
<PARAGRAPH>
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too
<PARAGRAPH>
Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
<PARAGRAPH>
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
(Baby, yeah)
<PARAGRAPH>
And when I'm feeling alone
You remind me of home
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
<PARAGRAPH>
And when the world isn't fair
I'll pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
To you
<PARAGRAPH>
Under the mistletoe (to you)
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
<PARAGRAPH>
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas (darling)
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
'Cause I love you
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true
I love you
