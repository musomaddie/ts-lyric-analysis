Combat
I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you
<PARAGRAPH>
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold onto you
<PARAGRAPH>
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?
<PARAGRAPH>
Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then hate my reflection, for years and years
<PARAGRAPH>
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold onto you
<PARAGRAPH>
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?
'Cause they see right through me
<PARAGRAPH>
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
<PARAGRAPH>
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold onto you
<PARAGRAPH>
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?
<PARAGRAPH>
And who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
<PARAGRAPH>
