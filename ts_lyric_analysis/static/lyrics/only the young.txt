It keeps me awake
The look on your face
The moment you heard the news
<PARAGRAPH>
You're screaming inside
And frozen in time
You did all that you could do
<PARAGRAPH>
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered, this time
<PARAGRAPH>
But only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young can run
Can run, so run
And run, and run
<PARAGRAPH>
So every day now
You brace for the sound
You've only heard on TV
<PARAGRAPH>
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
<PARAGRAPH>
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly, they forget
<PARAGRAPH>
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun
<PARAGRAPH>
Only one thing can save us
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young
<PARAGRAPH>
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young
<PARAGRAPH>
Only the young (only the young)
(Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time
Up there's the finish line)
Only the young
Can run
<PARAGRAPH>
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (can run)
Up there's the finish line
So run, and run, and run
<PARAGRAPH>
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (so run)
Up there's the finish line
And run, and run, and run
<PARAGRAPH>
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young
