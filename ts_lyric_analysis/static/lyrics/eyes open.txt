Everybody's waitin'
Everybody's watchin'
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eyes open
<PARAGRAPH>
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
<PARAGRAPH>
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
<PARAGRAPH>
Keep your eyes open
<PARAGRAPH>
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
<PARAGRAPH>
So here you are, two steps ahead and stayin' on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
<PARAGRAPH>
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah, you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open
<PARAGRAPH>
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes
<PARAGRAPH>
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
<PARAGRAPH>
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
<PARAGRAPH>
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
<PARAGRAPH>
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
