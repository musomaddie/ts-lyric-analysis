t's 2 A.M. in your car
Windows down, I pass my street
The memories start
<PARAGRAPH>
You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You think I'm gonna hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
<PARAGRAPH>
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
<PARAGRAPH>
It's 2 A.M. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
<PARAGRAPH>
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
<PARAGRAPH>
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
<PARAGRAPH>
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
<PARAGRAPH>
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
<PARAGRAPH>
You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You gave me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish, I wish, I)
<PARAGRAPH>
2 A.M., here we are
See your face
Hear my voice in the dark
<PARAGRAPH>
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Guess you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
<PARAGRAPH>
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
<PARAGRAPH>
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
<PARAGRAPH>
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
<PARAGRAPH>
You always knew how to push my buttons (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
You gave me everything and nothing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come rushing (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
Stand back where you stood (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would) (I wish I, I wish I)
<PARAGRAPH>
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I (I wish you would)
