Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play? Ayy
<PARAGRAPH>
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
<PARAGRAPH>
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
<PARAGRAPH>
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
<PARAGRAPH>
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
<PARAGRAPH>
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
<PARAGRAPH>
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
<PARAGRAPH>
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over), mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (yeah)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
