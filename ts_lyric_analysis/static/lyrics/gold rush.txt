Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in
<PARAGRAPH>
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
<PARAGRAPH>
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush
<PARAGRAPH>
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
<PARAGRAPH>
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round
Had nevеr seen a love as pure as it
And then it fadеs into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
<PARAGRAPH>
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush
<PARAGRAPH>
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
<PARAGRAPH>
At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found
Will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be
<PARAGRAPH>
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in
