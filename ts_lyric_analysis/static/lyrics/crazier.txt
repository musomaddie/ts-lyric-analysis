I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you opened the door
And there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything
<PARAGRAPH>
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
<PARAGRAPH>
I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe
<PARAGRAPH>
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh-oh
<PARAGRAPH>
Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore, oh-oh
<PARAGRAPH>
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
<PARAGRAPH>
Crazier, crazier...
