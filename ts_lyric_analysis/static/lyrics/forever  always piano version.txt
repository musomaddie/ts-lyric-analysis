Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught you eye
We caught on to something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
<PARAGRAPH>
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
<PARAGRAPH>
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, oh
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here, and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
<PARAGRAPH>
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
<PARAGRAPH>
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, oh
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here, and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
<PARAGRAPH>
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so
Ohh
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh back up
Baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up
Baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here, and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
<PARAGRAPH>
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here, and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
<PARAGRAPH>
You didn't mean it, baby
You said forever and always, yeah
