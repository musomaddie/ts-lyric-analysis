I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
<PARAGRAPH>
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
<PARAGRAPH>
The music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
<PARAGRAPH>
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
<PARAGRAPH>
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
<PARAGRAPH>
I never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout
<PARAGRAPH>
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
<PARAGRAPH>
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
<PARAGRAPH>
It's 2:00 a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2:00 a.m., feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
<PARAGRAPH>
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
<PARAGRAPH>
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry (yeah, yeah), I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (ooh, ooh), I'm sorry
