I love my hometown
As much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen
Faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
<PARAGRAPH>
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples ﬁrst and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives
<PARAGRAPH>
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
<PARAGRAPH>
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you, ooh
<PARAGRAPH>
And now I love high tea
Stories from Uni and the West End
You can ﬁnd me in the pub
We are watchin' rugby with his school friends
<PARAGRAPH>
Show me a grey sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English
<PARAGRAPH>
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
<PARAGRAPH>
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you
<PARAGRAPH>
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
<PARAGRAPH>
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (oh)
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause you know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Soho, drinking in the afternoon (yeah)
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (you)
<PARAGRAPH>
Took me back to Highgate
Met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (yeah)
You know I love a London boy (oh)
Boy (oh), I fancy you (I fancy you)
<PARAGRAPH>
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
(Boy, boy, I fancy you, oh whoa, oh, oh)
<PARAGRAPH>
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you
(Wanna be with you)
(I fancy you, yeah, I fancy you)
Ooh wooh ooh
