Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losing sleep
Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity
<PARAGRAPH>
She says, "That ain't my merlot on his mouth"
"That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
She says
<PARAGRAPH>
"I think he did it but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die
<PARAGRAPH>
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it
<PARAGRAPH>
Este wasn't there
Tuesday night at Olive Garden, at her job, or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires
<PARAGRAPH>
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out
'Cause
<PARAGRAPH>
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die
<PARAGRAPH>
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it
<PARAGRAPH>
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
<PARAGRAPH>
They think she did it but they just can't prove it
They think she did it but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it
<PARAGRAPH>
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he died
