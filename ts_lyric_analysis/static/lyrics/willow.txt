I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
<PARAGRAPH>
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
<PARAGRAPH>
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
But there was one prize I'd cheat to win
<PARAGRAPH>
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
<PARAGRAPH>
You know that my train can take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
<PARAGRAPH>
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90's trend
<PARAGRAPH>
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
<PARAGRAPH>
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
<PARAGRAPH>
You know that my train can take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
<PARAGRAPH>
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
<PARAGRAPH>
You know that my train can take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
<PARAGRAPH>
Hey, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
