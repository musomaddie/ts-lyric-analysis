Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
<PARAGRAPH>
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do
<PARAGRAPH>
Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
<PARAGRAPH>
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do
<PARAGRAPH>
And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause
He never did
<PARAGRAPH>
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
<PARAGRAPH>
You said you never met one girl who had
As many James Taylor records as you
But I do
<PARAGRAPH>
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do
<PARAGRAPH>
But you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause
He never did
<PARAGRAPH>
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
<PARAGRAPH>
And we walked down the block, to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
<PARAGRAPH>
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time
What's past is past
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny, 'cause
He never did
<PARAGRAPH>
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
<PARAGRAPH>
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
