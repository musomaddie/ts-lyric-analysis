The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
<PARAGRAPH>
Holy orange bottles, each night I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus, too
And I say to you
<PARAGRAPH>
Ooh-ah, soon you'll get better
Ooh-ah, soon you'll get better
Ooh-ah, you'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
<PARAGRAPH>
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
<PARAGRAPH>
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I'll say to you
<PARAGRAPH>
Ooh-ah, soon you'll get better
Ooh-ah, soon you'll get better
Ooh-ah, you'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
<PARAGRAPH>
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?
<PARAGRAPH>
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to
<PARAGRAPH>
Ooh, you'll get better
Ooh, you'll get better
Ooh-ah, you'll get better soon
'Cause you have to
