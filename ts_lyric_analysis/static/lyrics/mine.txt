Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
<PARAGRAPH>
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
<PARAGRAPH>
Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
<PARAGRAPH>
Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
<PARAGRAPH>
And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about
<PARAGRAPH>
Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
<PARAGRAPH>
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, oh, oh, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
And I remember that fight, two-thirty am
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
<PARAGRAPH>
Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"
<PARAGRAPH>
You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
<PARAGRAPH>
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
<PARAGRAPH>
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
