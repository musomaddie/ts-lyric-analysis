Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
<PARAGRAPH>
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you)
<PARAGRAPH>
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
<PARAGRAPH>
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
<PARAGRAPH>
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
<PARAGRAPH>
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat
<PARAGRAPH>
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."
<PARAGRAPH>
He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you." And I
I said, "I've been there too a few times."
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
<PARAGRAPH>
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
<PARAGRAPH>
Take me home
Just take me home, yeah
Just take me home
Out of style
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
