You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse
<PARAGRAPH>
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
<PARAGRAPH>
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems
<PARAGRAPH>
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating
<PARAGRAPH>
Dom PÃ©rignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
<PARAGRAPH>
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems
<PARAGRAPH>
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
<PARAGRAPH>
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
<PARAGRAPH>
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
<PARAGRAPH>
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in her head, " they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
<PARAGRAPH>
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
<PARAGRAPH>
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
<PARAGRAPH>
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
