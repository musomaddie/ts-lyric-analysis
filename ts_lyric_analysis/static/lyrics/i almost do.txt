I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me
<PARAGRAPH>
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do
<PARAGRAPH>
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye
<PARAGRAPH>
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I'd want to try again with you
And I almost do
<PARAGRAPH>
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do
<PARAGRAPH>
I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I hope
Sometimes you wonder about me
