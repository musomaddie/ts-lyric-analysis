aid, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
<PARAGRAPH>
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
<PARAGRAPH>
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ha
<PARAGRAPH>
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
<PARAGRAPH>
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is
<PARAGRAPH>
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ha
Wildest dreams, ah-ha
<PARAGRAPH>
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
<PARAGRAPH>
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
<PARAGRAPH>
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha
(Even if it's just in your)
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha
<PARAGRAPH>
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha
