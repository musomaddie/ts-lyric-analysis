Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
<PARAGRAPH>
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire
<PARAGRAPH>
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
<PARAGRAPH>
Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
<PARAGRAPH>
I rewind the tape but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double crossed
<PARAGRAPH>
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)
<PARAGRAPH>
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again
<PARAGRAPH>
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?
<PARAGRAPH>
And when I was shipwrecked (can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (all the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (to be certain we'll be tall again)
(If you think of all the costs)
<PARAGRAPH>
It was real enough (whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves being tossed)
But I swear (is there a line that we could just go cross?)
You were there
<PARAGRAPH>
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore (evermore)
<PARAGRAPH>
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore (evermore)
Evermore
