Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
<PARAGRAPH>
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah, oh, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this
<PARAGRAPH>
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah oh, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
<PARAGRAPH>
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah
We sang hallelujah
<PARAGRAPH>
Hallelujah
