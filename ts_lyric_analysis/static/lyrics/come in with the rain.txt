I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore and I
Know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore
<PARAGRAPH>
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
<PARAGRAPH>
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
<PARAGRAPH>
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far and I
I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
<PARAGRAPH>
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear
<PARAGRAPH>
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name, oh
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
<PARAGRAPH>
I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say
<PARAGRAPH>
But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
<PARAGRAPH>
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
