How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
<PARAGRAPH>
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished, but so grand
<PARAGRAPH>
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but it's been promised to another
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
<PARAGRAPH>
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
<PARAGRAPH>
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
<PARAGRAPH>
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
<PARAGRAPH>
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
<PARAGRAPH>
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
<PARAGRAPH>
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you
<PARAGRAPH>
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
<PARAGRAPH>
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
<PARAGRAPH>
In you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now I'm covered in you
In you
