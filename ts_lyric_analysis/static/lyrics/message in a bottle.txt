I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin'
Standing here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized
By freckles and bright eyes
Tongue tied
<PARAGRAPH>
But now
You're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
Message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
Could be the reason you can't sleep at night
Message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
<PARAGRAPH>
These days I'm restless
Work days are endless
Look how you've made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter
Disaster
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause now
You're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
Message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (it gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I (I)
Could be the reason you can't sleep at night
Message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
<PARAGRAPH>
How is it in London? (London)
Where are you while I'm wonderin' (wonderin')
If I'll ever see you again?
<PARAGRAPH>
You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
Message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (it gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I
Could be the reason you can't sleep at night (you can't sleep at night)
Message in a bottle is all I can do (yeah, yeah)
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (yeah, yeah)
<PARAGRAPH>
You could be the one that I love
(Love)
You could be the one that I love
(Love) my love
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you
