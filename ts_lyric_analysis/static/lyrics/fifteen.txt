You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
<PARAGRAPH>
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause when you're 15
And somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're 15
Feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out, well
Count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At 15
<PARAGRAPH>
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
<PARAGRAPH>
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up
And you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause when you're 15
And somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're 15
And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at 15
<PARAGRAPH>
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
<PARAGRAPH>
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause when you're 15
And somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're 15
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At 15
<PARAGRAPH>
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
