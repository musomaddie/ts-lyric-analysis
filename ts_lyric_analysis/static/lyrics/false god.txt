We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
<PARAGRAPH>
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?
<PARAGRAPH>
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
<PARAGRAPH>
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith
Blind faith
<PARAGRAPH>
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
<PARAGRAPH>
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
<PARAGRAPH>
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me
Honey hell is when I fight with you
<PARAGRAPH>
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
<PARAGRAPH>
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
<PARAGRAPH>
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost when you're led by blind faith
Blind faith
<PARAGRAPH>
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
<PARAGRAPH>
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah
<PARAGRAPH>
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love
