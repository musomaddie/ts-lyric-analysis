Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs
<PARAGRAPH>
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
<PARAGRAPH>
So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
<PARAGRAPH>
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine
<PARAGRAPH>
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty, little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
<PARAGRAPH>
And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong, and your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong, and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you
<PARAGRAPH>
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father
About your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours
<PARAGRAPH>
So don't you worry your pretty, little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
<PARAGRAPH>
And don't you worry your pretty, little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
<PARAGRAPH>
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
