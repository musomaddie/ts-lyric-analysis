Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you
<PARAGRAPH>
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone
<PARAGRAPH>
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, oh
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
<PARAGRAPH>
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close I feel like coming undone
<PARAGRAPH>
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
In the middle of the night, we can form this dream
I wanna feel you by my side, standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven
<PARAGRAPH>
I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone
<PARAGRAPH>
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Oh, oh, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta, come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Come on
<PARAGRAPH>
In the middle of the night, we can form this dream
I wanna feel you by my side, standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven
<PARAGRAPH>
Oh, oh
Oh
Oh
<PARAGRAPH>
And in the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Oh, come on, come on
Come on, come on
Oh, oh, oh, oh
<PARAGRAPH>
Like a million little stars
Spellin' out your name
They're spellin' out your name
Oh
